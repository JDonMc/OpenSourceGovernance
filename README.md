# OpenSourceGovernance
An attempt to form a universal consensus on unanimous decision making protocols. Not about where money should go, but about what we would do if we could. Bitcoin is majority rules, this is about unanimity.


## The first letter of the Ancient Hebrew Alphabet and The original document written in it, Genesis, is Aleph, meaning 1 or unity

Consensus reality, and everything in it, might as well be both a social construct and a group hallucination. Things only work because when we say/write/express what we mean, the interpretation is reasonably successful. But why do so many people experience failure, whether it's accidentally causing offense, or failed theories that when they attempt an experiment (or undertake any and all actions) often fail and require learning? There are arguably more failures than successes. You see, my mode of operation leads to nothing but success for the way I measure it. I create new words. That is the basis of truth. I don't change old words, but I will use old words in new ways. This is about achieving the First of things. Encountering the new and turning it into the knew. For example, through writing so much I come up with ideas from the things I'm writing, like right now I'm thinking of the word "knewing", which is the past tense the known, but it's also an active verb, so it's the facilitatory expansion of the "was once known" "old knowledge" and "what is no longer known" "prior knowledge", because when someone tells us a fact and we say "i knew that" it also means "i know that" but when it is "I knew such and such but then I realised I was wrong" it means "I used to/once did know that". So everything in the knewing is both what we know now and no longer know, which is the sum of all past failures and successes, but in an active form, meaning it's a function that produces future success. You might think past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance when it comes to stocks. But when it anything physical it is. It's just stocks are based on consensus reality's form of value. Which means it (at best) is majority rules, not unanimity.

Unanimity is the first lead up to the product of unity. We are not selling a product of unity, but we are producing a product of unity, through the process of reaching unanimity.

So for all things both "not necessary to achieve unanimous consensus", and "beneficial" to be enacted can be enacted immediately, by virtue of currently adopted practices such as for things like editing, spelling mistakes, grammar, punctuation, code mistakes, definition mistakes, policies that should be updated, etc. ie. as BDFL I will be following most insight given at a given. But for things where the community would like to achieve consensus on we will be taking input onto what are the best questions to (try and) achieve unanimous consensus on?

## Potential questions that could become Unanimous

How do we find potential questions that become unanimous?

Should we just ask all questions and see who agrees with who and assort their governance appropriately?

Is this what Multi Nationalism is?

Everywhere online we see information that crosses boarders and boundaries, and your influences and therefor interests are largely multi national. Is multi nationalism better than globalism?

Is peer review through publication an adequate filter for truth, and citations an adequate measure of truthfulness?

Is there a way to distinguish between positive and negative citations?

When there are alternative beliefs present that are mutually exclusive and it's contradicting to believe in both, would it matter if the reason provided that the alternative is concluding incorrectly is because it is being used by everyone on the alternative team? ie. A common denominator of an incorrect assumption, or a common faulty premise therefor a common faulty conclusion.

Can the truth be measured by a majority of opinions?

Therefor can consensus reality be a group hallucination?

Can consensus reality be wrong?

Should you rely on consensus reality?

How can consensus reality be wrong?


## Some questions have long answers, and some questions have yes/no answers

Remember, some of these questions when answered according to me leads me to believe this whole process of consensus is farce, except for the fact that the greater consensus the greater the result and unanimous consensus is ideal, but by the same token, I would not rely on it, (being BDFL) however if EVERYONE agreed, it would at least be acceptable to everyone, it's just that the limit of unanimity is essentially the extend of historical and ahistorical indoctrination. However, it does seem regardless of our attempt to achieve a consensus, there will always be an alternative grouping with an alternative consensus, because the smaller the group the easier it is to achieve. Which is why I have made to achieve consensus with myself that this would be a good idea.

## However, if we could agree to a law it would have to not be inflicting on us, therefor there will be no negatives to a unanimous consensus

It's just that it doesn't go far enough, you can't reach unanimous consensus without representative majority rules, or royalty, or a benevolent dictator, or head of the board or something similar.

The thing being that we must from generation to generation pass the torch of unanimous consensus.

For globalists and multi-nationals alike, the task of achieving a better outcome is achieving unanimous consensus. And for globalists to succeed they can boil the frog in water by achieving this.

## Some things we all already agree on

Every word in every language has an antonym and a definition. Therefor following this task is the first goal to truth. Or the first positive commandment, ie. not a "no" / "don't" commandment.

## I would like to clarify after writing this, we want a unanimous VOTE, not "consent" when that is manufactured by those who acquiesce when they think being combative / defensive / argumentative / oppositional would be useless. So it's not the same as a unanimous VOTE

If we all answer as many questions as we can we can look for what has a 100% positive to negative vote ratio. I posted things in the past that have garnered 100% vote ratio in select communities, which means in the greater community it too has been achieveable, by virtue of "definition" and "antonym" which is common across languages, then any form of linguistic / conceptual governance too must have the same notions.
